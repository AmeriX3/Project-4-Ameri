The Transcend is rated slightly faster but the cameras seem to like either equally well.  When I purchased this Transcend and the SanDisk were within pennies of each other, so aside from slight price and speed differences, there's not much to recommend one over the other.

Further, it is a good practice to have your &#34;personal&#34; stuff, like the things I just mentioned, saved to an external drive so as to not be in the mix should the horrific happen and you have to get your phone wiped.Word to the wise:  ENCRYPT YOUR STORAGE, both Primary Device and External SD.  For the Samsung Galaxy S4 (at least), that, in turn, requires that you use a phone unlock code of at least SIX characters, with at least one of them being non-numeric.  I know this can appear to be a pain in the butt, but the first time your device is ganked and you aren't panicking because your stuff is encrypted, you'll thank me.  Nekkid pictures aren't the only things of concern, mind you.  An unencrypted device, stolen by the wrong hands, isn't just $25 in crack cocaine money...it is much, much more than that in terms of lucrative identity theft opportunities.

The price is great for the size, for that I give it 5 stars. The transfer speeds are just disappointing though.. taking 5 minutes to transfer an iTunes movie file is a long time.. it'll take hours to fill the full card..

Our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 5.5&#34;-6&#34; displays, desktop grade processing power, OTG support for external peripheral accessories, powerful cameras, and more. The only thing was missing a super high capacity internal removable storage at an affordable price. 128GB micro SD announcement finally filled that gap, supported by amazon current sale of $119 shipped, but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handle/recognize this capacity. I was personally curious considering original Note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64GB only.Now, about the card itself. Its their Ultra edition with a read speeds of up 30MB/s and Class 10 performance. As part of Ultra edition it's considered to be waterproof, temperature-proof, x-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and also shockproof. In addition to a flash card itself, it also includes SD adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptops/PCs support SD card.So here comes the verdict: IT WORKS with Note 2!!! My Note 2 is all stock, Verizon SCH-I605 version, running stock Android 4.3. I checked the card first with an adapter on my laptop and then mounted it on my Note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity. I also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both long and accurate benchmark tests) to verify it with success. Read/write speed were not quite near 30MB/s, but it's still pretty good.My opinion? This card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to the next level!!! Now you don't have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in FLAC audio format, or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently, or take more high def videos, and so on. Just always stay up to date with backups. If flash card fails, it will be covered under warranty, but your pictures and videos will be lost forever.\",\n",

I've had to resort to copying no more than 1/3 gb of data at a time to these cards, stopping, then starting another 1/3 gb until the complete data is copied.

I have several other 128 gb flash memory sticks - the Lexar Echo series, as well as a hundred other lower-capacity flash memory cards, and do not have this overflow/error problem with any of those.

SanDisk took the 64gb card back without hesitation and was actually prepared to do it without the serial number (since I couldn't open my phone at the time because the case is screwed on.)Note to everyone:Quite a few applications don't fully support NTFS or newer file system formats such as exFAT. To use your SD card without issues you have to format it to FAT32 which IS possible even though its over 32GB. Use the &#34;Fat32Format&#34; tool made by Ridgecrop Consultants, there's a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version available for those unfamiliar with using the command line.------After receiving my new card I formatted it to fat32 since I use a lot of applications that aren't the norm and it's easier to use an older file system that is compatible with everything made after 1996.

       "  '624': \"My review is a little backwards&#8230; but I thought the most relevant should go first.WARNING: ONLY BUY THIS CARD ON SALE!The *typical* price since summer 2013 is about $24 for 32 GB, and about $48 for 64 GB.  DO NOT pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience.The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32GB and $35 for 64GB, in early December.  I basically buy when the price hits $20 or less, and the 64 nears $40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis.  They initially went on sale for about $17.95 and $34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively.  I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month.  On January 6th 2014, they still show as a &#34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher than I have *ever* payed for these cards!  So don't let the &#34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $27/$50, these are NOT a &#34;deal&#34; in terms of price.Okay, here's my actual &#34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability.I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot).  They're durable and waterproof, and  I can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting.  I even had one go through the wash, and I still use it for pictures.For the technically inclined, I have cards with *both* the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card.  I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the Nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other.  This should be possible with any SDXC/SDHC card, but it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I've found that works reliably.  Some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64GB will not boot in the Nook, but no 64GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me.  Samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so I still stick with these.  And that's good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share, these should drop even further in price.\",\n",
       "  '625': \"Work great with my Samsung Galaxy S4. Simple to install and redirect in settings. I don't get the memory warnings anymore.\",\n",
       "  '626': \"I had been using a 'regular' SanDisk 32GB Micro SD card that came included with my HTC Thunderbolt I bought in 2011. The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed.I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone.With my old MicroSD card, I had gotten used to just sitting there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures/videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC's hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC to my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quick to even bring up that &#34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very big transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I'm waiting for seconds instead of minutes.Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. Now I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is about the best you can even get for the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point. But perhaps my next phone will support 4K HD video onto 256GB cards and I will yet again need to upgrade my card's capacity and speed... Anyway, bottom line on this product: AWESOME.\",\n",

Tried it on my gf's S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn't hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can't return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala.

The Virtual Machine increases in size with regular use, and the operating system I was running is recommended for at least 40GB of max storage to operate properly.  Combined with the files I needed to store, and 64GB memory chip was no longer sufficient.The SanDisk Ultra 128GB MicroSDXC Class 10 Memory Card was able to handle that with ease, however I have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the 64GB chip than this one. I've actually ordered a second of these to see if I might have just received a flawed chip. If the replacement chip offers improvement I will revise this review.

I use this card to take all sorts of music and movies with me whenever I have to go anywhere, and there is absolutely no lag or hiccuping on playback.

And with this new card I can finally pack all of my music (~56GB), all of my photos, dozens of reference ebooks, and a few videos to boot and still I have around 9GB free as breathing room for my podcatcher.  The only real bummer with this card is the speed.  Just as I got acclimated to SanDisk's 64GB Extreme Plus level of speed, going back to ordinary class 10 speed that this card has is a little painful.  Luckily playing music or even playing videos doesn't oversaturate the read performance.  What WILL trip you up however is doing a straightforward copy or move operation while you're listening to something.  This card does not seem to handle multiple simultaneous operations without something going awry.  So long as you understand it's limitations and you can live with them, the enormous amount of storage you can pack into your phone or tablet is very welcome.So far I've used one of these in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100, LG G Pad, and a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact - all with success.\",\n",
